  <h1>Kabus - Monero Marketplace Script</h1>
</div>

## Introduction

The purpose of creating Kabus was to contribute to the Monero ecosystem and ensure its growth. It was never created for any illegal purpose, nor does it encourage such activities. The aim of this marketplace script is to facilitate the sale of legal products online as anonymously as possible.

Built with PHP 8.3 and Laravel 11.

## Core Features

### Monero Integration
- **Vendor Registration Payment**: Monero Wallet RPC integration that generates a wallet address for vendor fee payments, with support for separate transactions and a 24-hour payment window
- **Product Advertising Payment**: Integrated payment system for vendors to advertise their products on the homepage through Monero transactions
- **Product Purchasing**: Integrated Monero payment system for secure and anonymous product transactions
- **Return Address System**: Validation for user's Monero return addresses
